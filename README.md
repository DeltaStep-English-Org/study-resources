**DeltaStep English Education** is a new language school dedicated to solving common difficulties for students who are learning English.

We start from the bedrock foundation of pronunciation, because without this, your ability to speak clearly and ability to hear correctly, are compromised. If you can hear correctly, then your _language input **quantity and quality**_ will increase dramatically. 

Farran, the founder of _DeltaStep English_, is an English teacher in Viet Nam, and has been teaching Vietnamese students and online students from all around the world for 5 years already. He lives in the local society, spending time with Vietnamese friends every day, so he has become very familiar with the pronunciation system of Vietnamese, and he understands the reasons for Vietnamese people struggling with English pronunciation and grammar. 

As such, he has developed a bridging method to train Vietnamese students in how to use their mouths for pronouncing English clearly, from the very foundation of mouth control. He does not use simplistic methods like "copy this sound", because such methods are ineffective and do not help a student to create the required sounds. Instead, Farran trains students by teaching them the _technique_ for controlling their mouths correctly, enabling them to create sounds (phonemes) and syllables even before they have developed the listening ability to distinguish such sounds.

Farran has developed his training methods independently, and tests them regularly on his friends, acquaintances (such as restaurant & caf√© owners), and his students in language centres and online. His methods are consistently effective, but any such training requires mindfulness and careful, intentional mouth control by the student. In reality, a teacher can only show the student the way: it is still up to the student to see the path, walk the path, and use their own energy and attention to reach their goal. 

_DeltaStep English_ publishes self-study materials, targeted at Vietnamese students of English. In the near future, they will release some training courses, and eventually will expand into a language centre online and offline.
